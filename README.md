## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Extension

### What I learned

Although I use Javascript for handling error in my form. I learned how to use the `::after` pseudo-element to create a custom error message for the email input. I also learned how to use the `:invalid` pseudo-class to style the input when the email is not valid.


### Continued development

I want to continue to learn how to use the `::after` pseudo-element to create custom error messages for forms. I also want to learn how to use the `:invalid` pseudo-class to style the input when the email is not valid.
